# Bitcoin Mining Pools: Data & Dashboard

An open-source, full-stack data pipeline and interactive visualization suite for tracking the evolution of Bitcoin mining from Genesis to the present day. This repository serves two distinct products: a high-fidelity **Processed Dataset** and a zero-latency **Static Dashboard**.

---

## 🏗️ Two Products, One Repository

### 1. The Dashboard (Interactive Visualization)
A "no-build-step," fully static web application hosted on GitHub Pages. It leverages **hyparquet** to read multi-megabyte Parquet files directly in the browser, providing a buttery-smooth experience without a server.
- **8 Interactive Charts**: From market share donuts to geographic footprint (country share).
- **Miner Profiles**: Searchable, deep-dive profiles for over 150+ mining pools.
- **Decentralization Lab**: Real-time HHI (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) tracking and Top-3/Top-5 pool concentration benches.
- **Ecosystem Growth**: A historical scatter-line visualization of every pool discovered since 2011.
- **Mining Forensics & Reorg Risks**: Analyzes pool luck via Z-scores, propagation latency histograms, and timing entropy heatmaps to profile systemic network threats.

### 2. The Data Pipeline (Processed Insights)
A robust Python pipeline that transforms raw block-level data into high-performance, dictionary-encoded **Parquet** files.
- **Dual-Era Storage**: Data is split into `blocks_pre_2020.parquet` and `blocks_post_2020.parquet`. This enables users to fetch only the modern industrial era (~3MB) for recent analysis without downloading the entire 17-year history.
- **HHI Metrics**: Pre-calculated decentralization indices to track network health trends.

### 📊 Data Schema
Both parquet files use the following schema, optimized for size and speed:
| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `height` | `int32` | Block height (0 to tip) |
| `pool_slug`| `str (dict)` | Normalized pool ID (e.g. "foundryusa", "antpool") |
| `date` | `timestamp` | Block creation time (µs precision) |

### 🔄 Automated Updates
This is a **living dataset**. The reports and data files are updated:
- **Monthly**: A GitHub Action scheduled refresh ensures all monthly trend lines are finalized.
- **Node-Synced**: block data is pushed monthly directly from our self-hosted Bitcoin node to keep the modern era current.

## 📈 Data Insights: Beyond the Hashrate
This project isn't just about who is winning today; it’s about the **narrative of Bitcoin’s centralisation**. 
- Witness the **"Rise of the Industrial Era"** post-2020.
- Track the **"Great Migration"** as hash power shifted across geographic borders.
- Observe how the **network tip** reacts to halving events and the emergence of institutional-grade pools like Foundry and AntPool.
- Experience the **"Long Tail"** of Bitcoin history by exploring extinct pools from the 2011–2014 era.

## 🔌 Data Sources

We stand on the shoulders of the community. Our historical and real-time data is synthesized from:

1.  **Historical Blocks (0–869k)**: Sourced from [jlopp/bitcoin-blocks-by-mining-pool](https://github.com/jlopp/bitcoin-blocks-by-mining-pool). This incredible dataset provides the foundation of the historical records.
2.  **Pool Metadata**: Sourced from the [bitcoin-data/mining-pools](https://github.com/bitcoin-data/mining-pools/tree/generated) repository (generated branch), providing the mapping between coinbase tags, payout addresses, and pool identities.
3.  **Modern Tip (Post-2024)**: Continuously updated directly from a **self-hosted Bitcoin full node**, providing the most accurate, real-time insights into the current mining landscape.
